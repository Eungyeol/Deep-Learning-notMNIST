# Deep-Learning-notMNIST

### A deep learning project completed as part of Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program.

In this project I trained a variety of classifiers on the [notMNIST](http://yaroslavvb.blogspot.com/2011/09/notmnist-dataset.html) dataset to identify letters in images.
